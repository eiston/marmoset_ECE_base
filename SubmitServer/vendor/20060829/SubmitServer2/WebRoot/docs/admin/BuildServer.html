<h2> HOWTO set up a new BuildServer </h2>

<ol>

<li> Create a fresh directory.  I will refer to this directory as 'buildserver' in this
document but you may name the directory anything you'd like.

<li> Checkout from with CVSROOT=/fs/pugh/p/cvs into the freshly created buildserver directory
the following modules:
	<ul>
	<li> BuildServer
	<li> SubmitServerModelClasses
	</ul>

<li> cd into BuildServer

<li> run 'ant install' <br>
(ant is like make but for Java.  It is available from 
<a href="http://apache.ant.org"> http://apache.ant.org </a>.)
<b> NOTE: </b> This works with apache-ant-1.6.1 and apache-ant-1.6.2 but definitely
does not work with apache-ant-1.5.3.  I don't know about the versions between 1.5.3 and 1.6.1
so if it doesn't work then upgrade to 1.6.2 (which is the latest).
<br>
That should compile with no problems.

<li> cd into buildserver/BuildServer/run<br>
There will be two files, runBuildServer and config.properties<br>
make runBuildServer executable

<li> edit the 'supported.courses' property of the config.properties
to reflect the name of the course.  You should be able to uncomment one of the two lines.

<li> make sure the java.home property does not have 'jre' as the final part of the path,
e.g. /home/user/jdk1.5/jre.<p>
If this is the case, simply delete the final 'jre' part of the path.  This is a problem
because the jre directory does not contain javac which we need to build student projects.
I'm not sure why ant's notion of java's home directory is the jre directory.

<li> Also in config.properties, change the hostname property to reflect the hostname where
you'll be running a buildserver.

<li> Also in config.properties, edit the submit.server.hostname property if necessary.  Usefulb
values for this are 'submit.cs.umd.edu' (Production server) and 'marmoset2.umiacs.umd.edu' 
(Playground server).

<li> In the buildserver/BuildServer/run directory, do this:<br>
runBuildServer config.properties

<li> By default, the BuildServer is configured to handle one request and stop.
You can make the BuildServer test submissions in a loop by setting debug.donotloop to "false"
in the config.properties file.
