<h3> Notes on the research infrastructure </h3>

There are currently 2 database/tomcat installation pairs running on marmoset2.

<ul>
	<li> The "demo" server, which lets people from other universities create account and
		sample out system.
	<li> tomcat is located in $HOME/tomcat-demo and is configured to run on
		port 8443, and it's configured to look for mysql running on	port 3306 (the default)
	<li> The mysql database is located in /export/projects/marmoset/demo.submitServerDatabase
	and can be started and stopped with these commands:
	<p>
	$HOME/dbScripts/start-innodb demo.submitServerDatabase
	<p>
	$HOME/dbScripts/stop-innodb demo.submitServerDatabase

	<li> The research server, which serves up in the same database complete results from 
		spring 2005 and some results from fall 2004.  Note that it's called the "spring2005 database"
		but that's misleading because it contains all results from spring2005 plus some
		results from fall2004.
	<li> The research data has code coverage results for the BST project from both
	spring and fall (pk 6 is spring, pk 13 is fall)
	<li> The research data also has results with no coverage information for the other projects
	from spring 2005.
	<li> The resarch data has code coverage information for the webSpider for fall 2004 (pk 12)
	<li> For the research data, tomcat is located in $HOME/tomcat-spring2005 and is 
	configured to run on port 7443, and it's configured to look for mysql running on port 7306
	<li>The mysql database is located in /export/projects/marmoset/spring2005.submitServerDatabase
	and can be started and stopped with these commands:
	<p>
	$HOME/dbScripts/start-innodb spring2005.submitServerDatabase 7306
	<p>
	$HOME/dbScripts/stop-innodb spring2005.submitServerDatabase
	<p>
	<li> I had to delete the fall database because it was too big and most of the useful
	information	is replicated in the new spring database.  The text files with the 
	submissions and test outcomes from the old fall database are located on marmoset2
	in ~jspacco/paste2005/data
	<p><li> One other thing to keep in mind about the research data is that for the projects
	that Dave is looking at, all of the files full of links are linked to a testRunPK, so that
	when new FindBugs results are uploaded (as happened with the BST project where we ran it
	with and without an annotation on a certain method), it is still possible to access
	the old test runs (See the following bullet about loading new findbugs outcomes)
	
	<li> in /fs/pugh/p/cvs/jspacco/SubmitUtilities are the three useful utility classes:<p>
	DatabaseUtilities (connects to the database)<p>
	CheckSpecificWarnings<p>
	LoadNewFindBugsOutcomes<p> (you can ignore everything else in this package)<p>
	The LoadNewFindBugsOutcomes virtually runs a new test by creating a new test run
	and copy the results from the previous test run over but replacing the findbugs
	warnings with the new findbugs warnings it has been given.  Doing this too often
	will explode the size of the database.
	
</ul>
