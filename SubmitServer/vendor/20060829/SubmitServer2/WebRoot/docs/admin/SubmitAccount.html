<h1> Notes about the submit account and submit machine</h1>
<ul>

<li> The submit account runs on marmoset1.umiacs.umd.edu, which is also submit.cs.umd.edu
<li> Most of the submit software is located in /export/projects/submit
<li> Tomcat on that machine is configured to connect to a database which is only 
	accessible from localhost.  For the submit account, Tomcat is softlinked to:
	<br>
	$HOME/tomcat
	
<li> <font color=red>NOTE:</font> When using &lt; jakarta-tomcat-5.0.30, it is necessary
to comment out the Logger element near the bottom of tomcat/conf/server.xml.
<br>
This lets us use log4j as the default logging implementation and gives us much more
control over how things are logged.
<li> The database is backed up every hour using the following crontab entry:
<br>
MAILTO=jspacco@cs.umd.edu<br>
SHELL=/usr/bin/bash<br>
00 * * * *  cd $HOME/submit/dbScripts && export PATH=/export/projects/submit/mysql/bin:$PATH && ./dump.sh<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> This crontab assumes that the <a href="Database.hmtl"> dbScripts </a>directory (contained inside the 
SubmitServerModelClasses) is located at $HOME/submit/dbScripts.
<li> Currently the BuildServer is running on boo3.  The following crontab that checks the 
	BuildServer every 5 minutes:
	<br>
	MAILTO=jspacco@cs.umd.edu<br>
	*/5 * * * *  cd $HOME/cmsc13xBuildServerSubmit/BuildServer/run/ && ./checkDaemon.sh config.properties<br>
<li> There is a crontab entry on Marmoset2 that uses the SubmitMonitor project 
	to try to connect to the Production SubmitServer every 5 minutes.  
	The crontab looks like this:
		<font color=red> Finish this part </font>
