<font color=red><b>NOTE:</b></font>
This project is not yet active for automated testing of submissions.  This probably means
that the instructor has not yet uploaded a working reference implementation and assigned 
point values to each test case.
<p>
You can still submit your implementation, but the server will not test your 
submission until the project has been activated by the instructor.

<h1>File upload project submission</h1>
<p>Submit project ${project.projectNumber} for ${course.courseName} in
${course.semester}
<p>
<p>You may upload a Jar or Zip archive containing your project submission.
<p>The Jar or Zip archive must contain the <b>entire</b>project directory.
<br>If you are using Eclipse, this means your archive should include have the .project file
and src/ directories at the root of the archive.
<p>File generated by compilation (i.e. .class or .o files) will be discared by the server,
so don't worry if your submission includes them.
