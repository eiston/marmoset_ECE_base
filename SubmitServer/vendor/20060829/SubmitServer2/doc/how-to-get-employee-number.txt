You'll need to look up your "U ID" on www.ares.umd.edu.

Click the green "Login" link on the left hand side and login with your directoryID and password.

Then click on "Payroll and Human Resources" about halfway down the menu below the "Login" link.

This will open a sub-menu.  Click the "Display/Update Personal Data" item.

The first entry is labeled "U ID"; that's the one I need.
