				The next few chapters describe the process of preparing and uploading 
				project files through the Submit Server, which are then used by the 
				Build Server to compile and grade student submissions. This chapter 
				describes the files that make up this process and process of uploading 
				them into the Submit Server.
			</p><p>
				The process of building and testing one submission requires two files: 
				a <span class="emphasis"><em>submission archive</em></span> containing an implementation of
				the specification and a	<span class="emphasis"><em>test setup archive</em></span> containing
				test cases that either pass or fail when run against a submission. 
				Both of these files can be in the
				<a href="http://www.info-zip.org/" target="_top">zip</a> format or the Java jar
				format.
			</p><p>
				Some sample files are provided with the Marmoset Distribution and linked here:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
						<a href="samples/test-setup.jar" target="_top">test-setup.jar</a>: Test cases
						for an example specification.
					</p></li><li><p>
						<a href="samples/canonical.jar" target="_top">canonical.jar</a>: A submission 
						that completely implements the example specification.
					</p></li><li><p>
						<a href="samples/skeleton.jar" target="_top">skeleton.jar</a>: The initial project
						files given to students. This is essentially an incomplete implementation
						of the specification.
					</p></li></ul></div><p>
			</p><p>
				For the full set of examples and templates provided with the marmoset distribution,

				The next two chapters: <a href="javaprojects.html" title="Chapter 12. Creating Java Projects">Chapter 12, <i>Creating Java Projects</i></a> and 
				<a href="cprojects.html" title="Chapter 13. Creating C Projects">Chapter 13, <i>Creating C Projects</i></a> provide step by step instructions for creating
				the necessary files for Java and C projects respectively. The model used for
				C projects can also be used for other languages such as C++, OCaml and Ruby
				(see <a href="project_upload.html#other_supported_languages" title="6. Applying The C Model to Other Languages">Section 6, &#8220;Applying The C Model to Other Languages&#8221;</a>).
			</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="submissionarchive"></a>1. The Submission Archive</h2></div></div></div><p>
					Student submissions are stored in zip/jar files, referred to as
					<span class="emphasis"><em>submission archives</em></span>. They contain the source code 
					files for the student's project. They may also contain other files: for 
					example, test cases provided to the students, the student's own test 
					cases, image or data files, etc.
				</p><p>
					When setting up a project, an instructor must make a submission that
					passes all the tests. This submission archive is referred to as the 
					canonical solution. An example of a canonical solution is 
					<a href="samples/canonical.jar" target="_top">canonical.jar</a>.
				</p><p>
					Submission archives are usually created by archiving the entire
					student folder. Marmoset then looks for the source files and compiles
					them. This process is quite robust but sometimes problems can occur if
					files are in unusual places. The following rules are helpful to avoid
					any problems:
					</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
								In java projects, source files should be in a
								<code class="literal">src</code> directory and should be arranged in
								the standard directory structure. E.g. the class
								cs101.project1.HelloWorld should be located in 
								<code class="literal">src/cs101/project1/HelloWorld.java</code>.
							</p></li><li><p>
								In C projects, source and make files should be at the top 
								level.
							</p></li><li><p>
								Any non-source files referenced using relative paths should
								be in a directory structure that starts at the top level.
								This is because the programs are run from the top level. So
								if a program references <code class="literal">examples/input.txt</code>,
								then the directory <code class="literal">examples</code> should be at
								the top level of the archive.
							</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
								When student programs access non-source files, the
								<code class="literal">test.runInInstructorDir</code>
								property (in the test.properties file) determines which
								files are visible. If this property is true, then files
								the student's submission are not visible because the
								program is run from the instructor's directory, not the
								student's directory. See <a href="project_upload.html#testsetuparchive" title="2. The Test Setup Archive">Section 2, &#8220;The Test Setup Archive&#8221;</a>
								for more information about the test.properties file and

					If the project is done using the 
					<a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_top">Eclipse IDE</a>, the student
					can simply archive the entire project directory and submit this. 
					Marmoset uses Eclipse's <code class="literal">.classpath</code> file to figure
					out where all the source files are. There is also an Eclipse plugin
					provided by the University of Maryland that can be configured to
					allow students to submit from within Eclipse (see 
					<a href="eclipseplugin.html" title="Chapter 14. The Eclipse Plugin">Chapter 14, <i>The Eclipse Plugin</i></a>).

					All of the information about how to build and test submissions for a
					particular course project is contained in the
					<span class="emphasis"><em>test setup archive</em></span>. This archive is a zip or jar 
					file containing several elements:
				</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">The test.properties file</span></dt><dd><p>
								This is a Java properties file defining metadata about how
								to build and test a submission for the particular project.
								This file must be in the root directory of the test setup
								archive. For a detailed description of the test.properties file,
								see	<a href="project_upload.html#testproperties" title="3. Test Properties">Section 3, &#8220;Test Properties&#8221;</a>.
							</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Test Cases and Supporting Source or Object Files</span></dt><dd><p>
								The test setup archive contains source and/or object files
								needed to compile and test the student source code.
							</p><p>
								For Java projects, only .class files need to be provided in
								the test setup archive. (However, we recommend including
								source files in the test setup because this is often the only
								record of the test cases in the Marmoset database. Instructors
								and researchers that review your course in the future often
								want to see the source of the test cases.) 
							</p><p>
								The test setup jarfile is provided on the compile-time and
								runtime classpath for building/executing the student's
								code. For testing student code,
								<a href="http://junit.org/" target="_top">JUnit</a>
								test cases should be provided. More information is in
								<a href="javaprojects.html" title="Chapter 12. Creating Java Projects">Chapter 12, <i>Creating Java Projects</i></a>.
							</p><p>
								For C projects, either C source files or object files may
								be provided. (Again we recommend including the source
								files.) The individual test cases must be standalone
								executables linked against the student's modules. More
								information is in <a href="cprojects.html" title="Chapter 13. Creating C Projects">Chapter 13, <i>Creating C Projects</i></a>.
							</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Files needed by Test Cases at Runtime</span></dt><dd><p>
								If the test cases require files when they are executed,
								the files should be stored in the test setup jarfile.
								These files will be extracted into the
								<span class="emphasis"><em>testfiles directory</em></span>, and will be 
								available to the tests at testing time.
							</p></dd><dt><span class="term">The security.policy file (optional, Java-only)</span></dt><dd><p>
								For Java projects, a security policy file may be provided,
								specifying what privileges are granted to student code. It
								is important to prevent untrusted student code from
								forging test outcomes, sending secret test information
								over the network, etc. This file, if present, must be
								located in the root directory of the test setup jarfile.
							</p><p>
								If no security policy file is specified, a restrictive
								default security policy is used.
							</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Makefile (C-only)</span></dt><dd><p>
								Test setup jarfiles for C projects must include a Makefile
								capable of compiling the executables that will serve as
								the test cases. The Makefile must be in the root directory

					Upload Archives into Submit Server
				</h2></div></div></div><p>
					Once you have created the three archives, you are ready to initialize your project
					on the Submit Server by uploading these files. Go to the Project Utilities page to 
					upload all three archives. The test-setup and canonical archives can be uploaded
					at the bottom of this page. The skeleton is uploaded by selecting 
					"Upload new project starter files" in the Project Maintenance section.
				</p><p>
					Submit Server sends the test-setup and canonical archives to a Build Server for 
					testing. While this is happening, the state of your test setup should be set to 
					pending. If this is not the case, contact your Marmoset administrator to ensure 
					that the Build Servers have been activated. If any of the tests fail, the test-setup
					status will be set to "failed". Check to make sure the format of your archives is 
					correct.
				</p><p>
					Once all the tests in your test-setup pass on the canonical solution, the test-setup
					status is upgraded to "tested". This may take a few minutes. You can now assign points 
					to each of the tests by clicking the "Assign Points" link. When you assign points to a
					test-setup, it becomes the active test setup, meaning that all student submissions
					will be tested against this setup.
				</p><p>
					Once all this is done, you can make the project visible to students by selecting the
					"Make Visible" button at the top of the page.

					This section describes how the build server uses the test setup to test
					the submissions.				
				</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="directories"></a>5.1. Directories</h3></div></div></div><p>
					Two directories are used by the BuildServer at runtime. The
					<span class="emphasis"><em>build directory</em></span>
					is where the student submission is extracted. The
					<span class="emphasis"><em>test files directory</em></span>
					is where the test setup jarfile is extracted.
				</p><p>
					The idea behind keeping these two directories separate is that it
					prevents commingling of student and instructor files. However, for C
					projects, a single directory is used as both the build directory and
					the test files directory.
				</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="steps"></a>5.2. Building and Testing Steps</h3></div></div></div><p>
					The following steps are used when building and testing a student
					submission.
				</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
							The submission zipfile is extracted into the build directory.
						</p></li><li><p>
							The test setup jarfile is extracted into the test files
							directory.
						</p></li><li><p>
							The submission is built: either by issuing a command to build
							all of the source files in the submission (for Java projects)
							or by invoking a make command (for C projects). If the build
							fails, the compiler error messages are recorded and a failed
							build test outcome is recorded.
						</p></li><li><p>
							The public, release, secret and student tests specified in the
							test setup jarfile's test.properties file are executed and
							test outcomes recorded.
						</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="other_supported_languages"></a>6. Applying The C Model to Other Languages</h2></div></div></div><p>
					The buildServer supports two categories of programming languages: Java
					projects (which use a security manager and JUnit) and C or C-like
					projects (which use the
					<code class="literal">make</code>
					utility to create executable files which are then run run by the
					BuildServer.
				</p><p>
					The mechanism used for C projects is flexible enough that we've used
					it for Ruby and OCaml projects as well. Other langauges, such as C++
					or Python, will also work using the same mechanism.
				</p><p>
					Thus when we write "C project", keep in mind that this mechanism is
					extremely flexible and is not certainly not limited to projects
					written in the C language.
