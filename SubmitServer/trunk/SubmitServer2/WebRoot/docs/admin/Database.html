<h1> Notes about the Database </h1>

<ul>

<li> The Database uses MySQL and the fully transactional InnoDB table format.
<li> The SubmitServerModelClasses project contains a directory, dbScripts, which
has all of the database backup, startup and shutdown scripts.
<li> dbScripts/dump.sh is very useful shell script that takes a "snapshot" of the
database and writes it to $HOME/submitServerDatabaseBackups (it will create this 
directory if it does not exist).
<p>
The database backup files all look like this: backup.&lt;timestamp&gt;.sql and are 
an SQL dump of the entire database, complete with the necessary statements to recreate
the schema.

<li> The submit account has a crontab entry that captures a dump of the database every hour.
Details are contained in the <a href="SubmitAccount.hmtl"> SubmitAccount documentation</a>

<li> The script to start the database is dbScripts/start-innodb.  This script contains
a DIR variable at the very beginning that must be set to the root location of the actual
database files.  For the submit account, this is /export/projects/submit/submitServerDatabase,
though this directory is also symlinked to $HOME/submitServerDatabase.
<p>
For other machines running snapshots of the database (such as marmoset2 or boo3), the 
database will be located at $HOME/submitServerDatabase.

<li> All of the dbScripts assume that you have a properly configured $HOME/.my.cnf file.
This file is the default file MySQL looks for to figure out where to find the database.
This file must be kept secure because it contains the database password.
All of the databases are configured to allow connections from localhost only with a password,
even though it is typical to allow connections from localhost with no password.
<p>
The reason we require a password from localhost is because phpMyAdmin (our database
adminitration tool that runs through apache) connects to the database on localhost 
on the same machine and must not be allowed to connect without a password.  
I have never been able to figure out how to get phpMyAdmin to use a password of 
its own; it might not be possible.

<li> dbScripts/install is the coolest script.  Run it like this:
