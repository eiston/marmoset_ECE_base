Please very that you've given me your University ID (UID)

Note that your UID is *NOT* your Student ID (SID), which up until this
year was usually your social security number.
                                                                                                     
You can look up your UID using your Directory ID from the campus LDAP
page:
                                                                                                     
www.ldap.umd.edu
                                                                                                     
Let me know your UID if we had it wrong before or if you can't figure
out the problem.
