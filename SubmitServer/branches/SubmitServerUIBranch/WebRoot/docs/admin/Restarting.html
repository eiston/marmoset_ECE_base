<h2> How to restart the SubmitServer, database and BuildServer </h2>

Hopefully you'll never have to do this.

<h2> The database </h2>

<ul>
<li> If the database seems to have gone down, first make sure it's really dead:
<p> Log in to the submit.cs.umd.edu as submit.  Try running 'mysql' from the command line.
If it brings up a prompt and works, then the database is probably OK.
<p>
<li> All of the datbase scripts and utilities are in /export/projects/submit/dbScripts
<br> This is not submit's home directory, it's a separate directory on the RAID.
<p>
To collect profile info from database: /export/projects/submit/dbScripts/profile-innodb
<p>
To stop the database: /export/projects/submit/dbScripts/stop-innodb
<p>
To start the datbase: /export/projects/submit/dbScripts/start-innodb
<p>
That's all the basic things with the database.
<p>
<li> If heaven forbid the data gets corrupted, I'm storing hourly snapshots here:
<br>
/export/projects/submit/submitServerDatabaseBackup
<p>
These are getting huge but we're not close to running out of space yet.
<p>
<font color=red><b>NOTE:</b></font> Please don't do this unless absolutely necessary!
<br> If the database gets corrupted and you need to restore from a backup, then pick
one of the backups (call it "backup.foo.sql.gz") from /export/projects/submit/submitServerDatabaseBackup
and unzip it (producing "backup.foo.sql").
<br>
Then do this:<br>
/export/projects/submit/dbScripts/install backup.foo.sql
<br>
This should do everything necessary to restore.
<p>
If that doesn't work, then you can delete everything in the database, start
mysql from the command line, and do "source backup.foo.sql" which should regenerate things.
All of the backup files are stored as a giant series of SQL statements for maximum
portability and error tolerance.
</ul>

<h2> The SubmitServer </h2>
<ul>

<li> First try logging in to the submitServer:
<br>
<a href="https://submit.cs.umd.edu/"> https://submit.cs.umd.edu/ </a>
<br>
If you don't have an account on the submitServer, you can always use the test account:
<br>
DirectoryID: freddy<br>
password:	bar<br>
<p>
This account has no privileges, it only exists to make sure the server is working.

<li> One error tomcat gives is to give a listing of the available context, which
<a href="rootcontext.html"> looks something like this </a>.  This will go away
if you shutdown and startup tomcat.

<li> If you can log in but you get a screen <a href="badlogin.html">like this</a>
then the server is in one of its failure modes and needs to be restarted.  I don't know
why it will let you log in before telling you that it can't find resources that are there,
but that's what tomcat does.

<li> To restart, log in to the submit account: submit@submit.cs.umd.edu<br>
prompt% cd $HOME/tomcat/bin<br>
prompt% ./shutdown.sh<br>
prompt% ./startup.sh<br>
wait a few seconds<br>
prompt% ./shutdown.sh<br>
prompt% ./startup.sh<br>
<p>
It's almost always better to start it and stop and then start it again.  I don't know
why and I don't really ask any questions.
<p>
Now try logging in again.  It should work and bring you to the main menu, which should look
something <a href="successfullogin.html"> like this </a>, except that formatting will be pretty
and it will have more colors.

<li> Sometimes restarting doesn't help.  In this case, first shutdown the
SubmitServer in the normal way: <br>
cd $HOME/tomcat/bin<br>
./shutdown.sh
<p>
Then you'll need to delete the 
current web files and restart tomcat.  There may be several contexts in $HOME/tomcat/webapps,
for example <b>submitServer</b> and <b>newSubmitServer</b>.  If that happens delete all of
the directories and leave all of the .war files.
<p>
prompt% cd $HOME/tomcat/webapps
prompt% /bin/rm -rf submitServer
<p>
and then restart it the usual way:
<p>
prompt% cd $HOME/tomcat/bin<br>
prompt% ./shutdown.sh<br>
prompt% ./startup.sh<br>
wait a few seconds<br>
prompt% ./shutdown.sh<br>
prompt% ./startup.sh<br>

<li> After restarting, always log in with the test account to make sure things actually 
restarted.  Tomcat is stable, but for some reason often doesn't start up properly.

</ul>

<h2> The BuildServer </h2>

<ul>

<li> The BuildServer is a java process that periodically asks the submitServer for student 
projects to compile and test, and then sends the results of the tests back to the submitServer.

<li> There is a cronjob that runs in my account (jspacco) that checks to make sure the buildSever
is still running every 5 minutes, and restarts it if necessary.  It should not be possible for the
BuildServer to go down and not start itself back up.  I have tested that after killing the 
BuildServer from the command line allows it, the crontab starts it up again.  But we can't be sure
that this will always work.

<li> There's no useful way to know if the buildServer is down.  Basically one of the instructors will
notice and email that there's a problem when submissions stop getting built.  You can check to see if the
BuildServer is down like this: 'ps -auxwww | grep BuildServer' and see if there's a java process
with the word BuildServer in it anywhere.

<li> If it's necessary to restart the buildServer, login to marmoset2.umiacs.umd.edu as jspacco 
(or log in as root and then become jspacco) and then do this:
<p>
prompt% cd /export/homes/jspacco/buildServer/BuildServer/run<br>
prompt% ./runBuildServer config.properties

<li> This probably won't be necessary as the crontab has never failed to restart the BuildServer.

</ul>
