<h2> SubmitServer Instructor's Documentation </h2> If there's
something you think needs to be documented for future instructors,
please email me (Jaime) and I'll add it to this list.

<ul>

<li> <font color=blue> DO NOT INCLUDE YOUR SOLUTION IN YOUR TEST-SETUP
JAR OR ZIPFILE </font>
<p>
This is extremely important.  If you include your solution with the
test-setup, your reference solution will clobber each student's
submission, and they will all receive perfect scores.
<p>
It's very important for you to be careful about this because you won't
notice that there's a problem until students or TAs start submitting.
<p>
There's no trivial way for the server to detect it if you've
accidentally included the reference solution with the test-setup
jarfile, and I haven't had time to implement non-trivial solutions to
this problem.  So be vigilant!

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> </font>
<p>


<p>
<li> <font color=blue> You can now make test outcomes visible to students after
the late deadline has passed.</font>
<p>
You can set this feature in 2 places
<p>
This is an all-or-nothing feature-- either they see results of all public, private and release tests
or they see nothing.  Please be careful with this feature, it's very new and hasn't been
thoroughly tested yet-- I think it respects extensions on a per-student basis but I've only
lightly tested it.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> Make sure that you get the UID, not the SID </font>
<p>
The university has 2 different numbers for students-- their UID (also know as Employee Number)
which is a unique identifier-- and their SID (or Student ID) which up until this year
defaulted to the Social Security Number.  Make sure you use the UID when registering students
and TAs.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> Sessions and Cookies </font>
<p>
We use sessions and cookies so for example you can't be logged in with
your instructor and student account in different windows of the same
browser.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> The campus LDAP server we use for authentication periodically refuses
connections </font>
<p>
I suspect this is because it's overloaded.  These errors are normally transient and go away after
a minute or two.  If this happens to you or happens to one of your students, try logging
in again in a minute or two.
<p>
The stack trace will look like this:

<li> <font color=blue> Sessions Timeouts </font>
<p>
The session timeout is pretty short, I think only 15 or 30 min.  If
your sessions times out and the very next operation you try is an
HTTP-post operation, this will fail.  The reason is that the redirect
to the login page loses the actual post information, so after logging
in your will be re-directed back to the post page, but without the
required bits of post request.
<p>
This is annoying, but not really a bug.  Just
remember to re-authenticate yourself (you can do that by reloading the
current page) before trying an HTTP-post operation.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> TAs can now see invisible projects </font>
<p>
Your TAs will be able to view and submit projects as soon as
projects are created; i.e. you <b>DO NOT</b> need to mark a project as
"visible to students" for TAs to view the project and submit their own
implementations.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> You can add/remove TA permissions </font>
<p>

There are links from /view/instructor/course.jsp that allow you to
add/remove TA permissions for people that have been registered for
your class.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> Your "canonical" account </font>
<p>
Each person has a "canonical" account.  This account must
<b>ONLY</b> be used to submit reference implementations.  You can
submit reference implementations through Eclipse, using the
command-line tool, or using the "Project submission via jar file for
canonical account" web form available at /view/instructor/project.jsp.
Note that you must use your regular instructor account (NOT the
canonical account) to access the web form.  Also note that you can
view canonical test outcomes with your instructor account.  Thus it
should <b>never</b> be necessary to log into the server directly with
your canonical account.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> Any instructor can submit as the canonical
account by using the web form (and the web form <i>only</i> </font>
<p>
The way we create your instructor, canonical, and test student
account makes it impossible to share a canonical account without
sharing a DirectoryID password.
<p>
However, for courses with 2 instructors, either instructor can submit
a canonical solution from the web form located at
/view/instructor/project.jsp
<p>
Currently you cannot change the canonical account once you've created
a project.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> Your student test account </font>
<p>
Your instructor account has a "student" view as well as an
"instructor" view.  However, if you want to see <i>exactly</i> what a
student would see when logging into the system, log in with your
student account.  The username is &lt;DirectoryID&gt;-student and has
the same password as your regular DirectoryID.  If for some reason you
don't have a student account, let me know and I'll create one.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> There are 3 levels of permissions: Instructor,
TA, and Student </font>
<p>
Instructors and TAs can both view all information about everyone
else's submissions-- including each other-- whether or not they have
used release tokens.
<p>
TAs cannot create or modify projects, register students, or add/remove
TA privileges.  If you (or your TAs) ever discover that TAs can do any
things they should not have permissioni to do, tell me right away.
<p>
Students cannot do any of the above-- they can only submit and view
their own work, and can only view release test results subject to
their use of release tokens.
<p>
Technically there's another level of permission for the canonical
account, but this account should only ever be used to submit reference
solutions.  You should not ever need to directly log into the server
with your canonical account.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> Class Accounts are just a unique identifier for a student
registration </font>
<p>
But the SubmitServer does not communicate with any of the clusters
where students have class accounts and so does not actually know (or
care) that the class accounts are accurate.
<p>
Note that I sometimes use the terms 'class account' and 'cvs account' interchangeably
but they mean the same thing-- it's just a unique identifier for a student
who's registered for a particular class.  It doesn't really have anything to do with CVS.
<p>
Thus, if your course is not assigning class accounts on one of the
clusters, when registering students use the students' DirectoryIDs in
place of their class accounts.  This method will only fail if the student is
registered for multiple courses that are using the SubmitServer, but
that will not be the case in Fall 2005.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> Don't use the /submitServer context anymore </font>
<p>
Don't use the /submitServer context anymore.  Last semester, you
could use https://submit.cs.umd.edu and
https://submit.cs.umd.edu/submitServer interchangably.  Now you should
always use https://submit.cs.umd.edu instead.
<p>
The context stills work this semester, but I'd like to phase out the
use of this context because of some issues in Tomcat.
<p>
Some places where stray references to the /submitServer context may be
are in .submit files, either in Eclipse or in whatever template you
use to populate your CVS repositories, and in any BuildServer you
might be running.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> Java projects now support student-written tests
</font>
<p>
If you specify a classfile in the test.properties file like this:
<p>
test.class.student=StudentTests
<p>
and include a JUnit classfile called "StudentTests" with no tests (or
one smaple test or whatver) for students to put their test cases into,
we'll run these test cases on the server and store the results in the
database.
<p>
Note that you <i>must</i> include a JUnit classfile, even if it has
one silly test, or the BuildServer won't be able to test your submission
(I'll eventually make the bulid process more tolerant of this).
<p>
Currently instructors and TAs can view results and coverage information for student-written
tests, but in a primitive way.  This will improve when I have time to work on it.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> For Java projects, test coverage information is
only visible to TAs/Instructors </font>
<p>
There was some discussion last week as to whether students can see the
coverage information-- the answer is "no".
<p>
Eventually students will be able to see coverage information for their own 
student-written tests.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> You can't view the source for C, OCaml or Ruby
projects--only Java projects</font>
<p>
This feature simply won't work with non-Java files.  Soon I'll make
this generate an error message but until then, be aware that this
feature doesn't work for non-Java files.

<p>
<li> <font color=blue> Some notes about due dates </font>
<p>
Due dates are defined upto the second, for example:
<p>
2005-09-15 22:00:00
<p>
Note that dates use a 24-hour clock.
<p>
There are 2 important due dates to set: the on-time and the late
deadline.  If you make them the same then there is effectively no late
deadline.
<p>
When creating a project you can also specify the penalty for late
submissions by specifying a 'constant' that will be subtracted from
the score of all late submissions-- for example a 20 point penalty--
or a 'multiplier' that will be applied to all late submissions-- for
example late submissions are worth 0.8 (80%) of their value.
<p>
Values for late projects are applied dynamically in case you decide to
change the late penalty for a project.
<p>
You can grant extensions for a given project from the main instructor
view of that project.  Extensions are granted on a per project basis
and are given in HOURS.
<p>
These two deadlines split all submissions into 3 classes: on-time,
late and very-late.  When you download the student submissions, you
will get the "best" on-time and late submission after taking into
account the late penalties.
<p>
We define the "best" submission as the max of the most recent
submission and the most recent release-tested submission.  This
behaviour is unfortunately not at all configruable, so tell students
that if they submit something worse than a previous submission, they
can always download a previous submission from the web interface and
submit the older version instead.
