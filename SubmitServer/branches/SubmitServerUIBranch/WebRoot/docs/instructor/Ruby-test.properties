# Example test.properties for an ruby project

# Please note that your test.properties file

# Unless you are running your own buildServers, please use the default make

# Filename of the makefile: by default, the make command is
# invoked without specifying a Makefile filename.
# Unless you have a reason to change this, please use the default
# value.

# List of test executables.
# These should be created by the Makefile contained in the
# test-setup zip-file.

# If you do not want to have a class of test,
# PLEASE COMMENT OUT THE ENTIRE ENTRY!
# Do not leave test classes blank because the buildServer will
# not handle this.

# The name of each executable is used as the test name
# when test results are reported.

# Note that students will *ONLY* see the names of these tests, so the names

# And specify secret tests here...
# If you don't want any secret tests, leave this entire line commented out.

# Don't set this too high or students with lots of infinite loops
