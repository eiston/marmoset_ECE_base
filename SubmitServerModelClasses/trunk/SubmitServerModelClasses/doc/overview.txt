NOTE: schema.sql has been moved to dbScripts

This project contains the SubmitServer model classes.  These classes model
rows of the database and are all valid JavaBeans.

When adding a field to one of the Model Classes, you must do three things:

1) Add the filed to ATTRIBUTES_LIST array in the proper place.  This list is ordered according
	to the order of the columns in the database and must match the column name exactly.

2) Add a private field to the class using camelCase (the database fields use underscores)

3) You need to modify at least the update(), insert() and fetchValues() methods to take 
	into account the new fields.  Some classes have generic populatePreparedStatement()
	methods that handle both cases in a fairly general way.  Some of the classes have 
	actual insert() and update() methods that need to be changed by hand.  All classes
	need to have their fetchValues() method updated.


In addition, there are a couple of Utility classes in this package:

Queries: static methods that represent queries that return rows from multiple tables 
of the database and therefore could not be assigned to a particular class.

StatementAndResultSet: utility class that contains a PreparedStatement and the ResultSet
produced by executing the statement.  The close() method will close both of these items.

Formats: Contains formatting information for dates.

Debug: Basically a wrapper for logging that will eventually be replaced by commons-logging.
